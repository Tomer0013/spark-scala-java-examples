# Spark Examples
This repo contains a bunch of short Spark examples to be used as reference. All examples are both in Scala and Java.
Scala examples are taken from the course: https://www.udemy.com/course/apache-spark-with-scala-hands-on-with-big-data/. 
I converted all of the original Scala scripts to Java for practice and future reference.

The data used is also from the course mentioned above, so I cannot include it in this repo. I kept only the dir structure for things to make sense.
